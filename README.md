What the project goal?

- To help portray my understanding of HTML thus following Odin Project & to timestamp my progress for self-reflection + documentation.

What did you learn & realize throughout this project?

- The use of target="_blank" is highly effective when handling multiple links & saves the headache of having to backtrack.

- readability is important. It does not look nice whether it's web-development, coding, or even just looking at a page.

- When redundancy happens like making a repeated list, it's a good idea to have a rough draft of your layout so you know when to just copy and paste similar formats rather than typing everything out to save time.

- Having multiple directories & files specifying certain topics/categories helps keeps everything organized. While one can just jam everything on one file it's not as pleasing to the eye and may lead to other unseen issues.

- Learning to keep a consistency with your Whitespace is important. I need more practice with this but one thing for sure is that if used properly, it can enhance the readability of ones codes.

- the use of comments are great and should be used often when necessary to not just help you but also any viewers.

- the use of commit initially and throughout your coding can be important to see what you have done so far. The bigger a project and more people participating, the more powerful this tool becomes.
