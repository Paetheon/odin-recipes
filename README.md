What has been updated/changed?

the inclusion of CSS to further enhance my webpage. The main goal though was to get practice in and to gain more experience by experimenting. 

- a lot of things became clear and a tad easier to implement after gaining some new knowledge and coming back to this level.

What did you learn & realize throughout this project?

- The use of target="_blank" is highly effective when handling multiple links & saves the headache of having to backtrack.

- readability is important. It does not look nice  when everything is jumbled; whether it's web-development, coding, or even just looking at a page.

- When redundancy happens like making a repeated list, it's a good idea to have a rough draft of your layout so you know when to just copy and paste similar formats rather than typing everything out to save time.

- Having multiple directories & files specifying certain topics/categories helps keeps everything organized. While one can just jam everything on one file it's not as pleasing to the eye and may lead to other unseen issues.

- Learning to keep a consistency with your Whitespace is important. Practicing a similar format can help in the long run.

- the use of comments are great and should be used often when necessary to not just help you but also any viewers.

- the use of commit initially and throughout your coding can be important to see what you have done so far. The bigger a project and more people participating, the more powerful this tool becomes since it can help one understand someone's train of thought.

what else have you learned?

- there no right or wrong answer when it comes to building a web page.

- aside from best practice, there a multitude of paths that can be taken to achieve the same goal.

- only through experimenting and getting stumped will one learn what works best and fit their style.

- shorthand property is not always best practice in certain scenarios especially when things needs to be changed.

- order and keeping a consistent flow with your format is important for it can be confusing when you need to go back and check your work.
